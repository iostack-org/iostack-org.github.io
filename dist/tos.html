                    <p>Last updated: June 19, 2024</p>

                    <p>Thanks for your interest in iostack.ai!</p>
                    <p>When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to <a
                            href="https://iostack.ai">iostack.ai</a>.</p>
                    <p>When we say “Services”, we mean our website and our conversational ai platform, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop
                        application,
                        mobile application, or another format.</p>
                    <p>When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account
                        with one or
                        more of our Services. 
                    <p>We may update these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) in the future. 
                        Whenever we make
                        a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take
                        any other
                        appropriate steps to notify account holders.</p>
                    <p>When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may
                        be times
                        where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not
                        mean we are
                        waiving that right or provision. <strong>These Terms do contain a limitation of our
                            liability.</strong></p>
                    <p>If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account. That’s a broad statement and it
                        means you
                        need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about 
                        what we do, and keeping an open door to your feedback.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="account-terms">Account Terms</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for
                            ensuring that any
                            of your users do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage
                            from your
                            failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
                        <li>You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our <a href="./use_restrictions.html">Use
                                Restrictions policy</a>, and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either.</li>
                        <li>You are responsible for all content authored by you and any activity that occurs under your account,
                            including
                            content authored by and activity of any users in your account.</li>
                        <li>You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not
                            permitted.</li>
                    </ol>
                        <li>We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or
                            future use of
                            our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your
                            account will
                            not be able to access the account or any content or historical data in the account. Termination will
                            furthermore result in
                            the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and
                            relinquishment of
                            all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to
                            anyone for
                            any reason at any time. 
                        <li>Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of a
                            Company
                            employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2 id="uptime-security-and-privacy">Uptime, Security, and Privacy</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and
                            “as
                            available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for most of our Services — here’s
                            <a href="https://basecamp.com/about/policies/sla">the one exception</a> — but do take uptime
                            of our
                            applications seriously. Visit <a

                            status of our Services.</li>
                        <li>We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and
                            encryption. We
                            enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p>When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart.
                                You agree that
                                iostack.ai may process your data as described in our <a
                                    href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>
                                and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>To help you with support requests you make.</strong> We’ll ask for express
                                    consent
                                    before accessing your account.</li>
                                <li><strong>On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process
                                        partway
                                        through.</strong> We get notifications when such errors occur. When we can
                                    fix the issue
                                    and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In
                                    rare cases, we
                                    have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare
                                    cases, we aim
                                    to fix the root cause to prevent the errors from recurring.</li>
                                <li><strong>To safeguard iostack.ai.</strong> We’ll look at logs and metadata as part of
                                    our work to
                                    ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may
                                    also access
                                    accounts as part of an abuse report
                                        investigation</a>.

                    <h2 id="features-and-bugs">Features and Bugs</h2>
                    <p>We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers
                        who share
                        their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We
                        make no
                        guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.</p>
                    <p>We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our
                        Services
                        inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones,
                        especially any
                        related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee
                        completely
                        error-free Services.</p>
                    <h2 id="services-adaptations-and-api-terms">Services Adaptations and API Terms</h2>
                    <p>We offer Application Program Interfaces (“API”s) for our Services . Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that
                        accesses the
                        Services, is bound by these Terms plus the following specific terms:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses
                            resulting from your
                            use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</li>
                        <li>Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality is part of an
                            application that
                            remotely records, monitors, or reports a Service user’s activity <em>other than time
                                tracking</em>, both
                            inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if
                            an
                            integration service violates this bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an
                            integration for
                            the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove that integration.</li>
                        <li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the
                            temporary or
                            permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. The Company, in its sole
                            discretion, will
                            determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account’s access,
                            we will
                            attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we
                            may cut off
                            access without prior notice.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2 id="liability">Liability</h2>
                    <p>We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:</p>
                    <p><strong><em>You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in
                                equity, to

                                consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for
                                loss of
                                profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been
                                advised of the
                                possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the
                                Services; (ii)
                                the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data,
                                information

                                (iv)

                                relating to these

                                passive), or any other theory of liability.</em></strong></p>
                    <p>In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet
                        does not work
                        out, that’s on you, not us. We do our best to be as safe a bet as possible through careful
                        management
                        of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent. If you choose to use our Services,
                        thank you for
                        betting on us.</p>
